 **** It all started for me in 1982, when I was 10 years old and buying magazines at my local store to get code snippets out of them for my Commodore 64. I would spend hours typing out code to get a simple pac man style game out of it. I have loved computers and software for as long as I can remember. 
      I remember getting my second computer in 1995 with windows 95 and AOL for my internet service. With this computer I would play for hours just trying to figure  out  all of its little corks. I guess what I’m getting at is, I have always had a love for computers but back then I thought you had to be a rocket scientist to code.  Now adays I can’t wait to get off work so I can get to my coding studies. MY dream job would be at a cool start up, working to better the way people do everyday tasks.
			I love the material at Learn.co and all the people that make up this awesome community. We can study and learn together as a team to pull each other through the hard times. Thank you, to all at Learn.co!!!
